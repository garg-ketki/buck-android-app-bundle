# Buck Android App Bundle

This is a simple project to demonstrate issue with current buck's implementation to support [Android App Bundles](https://developer.android.com/guide/app-bundle/)

---------------------------------

Also, this project can be used to test [bundletool](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/bundletool) usage and get to learn more about it.

## Validating an Android App Bundle

`./tooling/app-bundle/validate-bundle <path-to-.aab-file>`


##  Building and installing a bundle generated by gradle

Run:
`./tooling/app-bundle/build-and-install gradle`

The above script will:
* Generate the app bundle, through `bundleDebug` gradle task
* Use `bundletool` to generate the apks set
* Use `bundletool` to install the right combination of apks in the connected device

Note that it will only work if you already have a connected android device on adb.

##  Building and installing a bundle generated by buck

Run:
`./tooling/app-bundle/build-and-install buck`

The above script will:
* Build the app bundle, through `//app:bundle_debug` rule
* Nothing else, as currently the build fails
